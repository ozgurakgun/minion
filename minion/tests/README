This directory used to contain tests for the internals of Minion, but
they have all decayed beyond compiling some time ago. A single test
has been left as an example of how to link directly into Minion.

Note that this is NOT SUPPORTED, NOT TESTED, and it's HIGHLY LIKELY if
you try basing any code on this it a) won't work, b) will be broken even more
by next week, and c) not compile in a month. This is only here as a sanity
test for if the parser gets badly broken / rewriten that the internals
are still reasonably working.

If you want to try compiling it, you'll have to add a " -I.. " to the command
line.

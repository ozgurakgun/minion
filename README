Welcome to the Minion source!

The minimum verson of CMake you'll need is 2.4.7. You'll also need Boost (at
least version 1.33).

The first thing to do is to run CMake to configure minion:

cmake .

This will look for the location of your compiler, and a few system libraries.
If you ever add additional constraints, or add or remove files, then
you should re-run cmake. The Makefile is generated by CMake; it is safe to
delete it.

After that, you can compile minion by doing:

make minion

which should produce the binary "minion" in the bin/ directory.

If you want to build the debug version, re-run cmake like

cmake -DDEBUG=1 .

and then type

make minion

again. This should produce the "minion-debug" binary in the bin/ directory.  The
debug version is much slower but has a large amount of internal checks. It
should be used if you are unsure / worried about the results minion produces, or
it crashes.

Note that CMake caches your configuration between runs, i.e. just running

cmake .

after having built the debug version will again produce Makefiles for the debug
version. To turn debugging off, run

cmake -DDEBUG=0 .

To test your minion installation, go into the test_instances directory
and type:

./run_tests.sh ../bin/minion

the "docs" directory contains a full manual for Minion. 
The "benchmarks" directory contains a range of example programs.
The "generators" directory contains a number of generators. These are
in general poorly documented. Sorry.

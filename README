Welcome to the Minion source.

Minion does does not have a traditional configure file. The quickest way
to get started, which will work for most people using a unix-type system
is:

make minion
make minion DEBUG=1

which will make two binaries in the bin directory, called "minion" and
"minion-debug". minion-debug is much slower but has a large amount of
internal checks. It should be used if you are unsure / worried about
the results minion produces, or it crashes.

To test your minion installation, go into the test_instances directory
and type:

./run_tests.sh ../bin/minion

the "docs" directory contains a full manual for Minion. 
The "benchmarks" directory contains a range of example programs.
The "generators" directory contains a number of generators. These are
in general poorly documented. Sorry.

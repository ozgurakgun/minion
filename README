Welcome to the Minion source!

The first thing to do is to run Minion's configure script:

./configure.sh

This will look for the location of your compiler, and a few system libraries.
If you ever add additional constraints, or add or remove files, then
you should re-run the configure script. Note that you should NOT delete the
Makefile before re-running the configure scripts, it is not auto-generated.

After that, you can compile minion by doing:

make minion
make minion DEBUG=1

which will make two binaries in the bin directory, called "minion" and
"minion-debug". minion-debug is much slower but has a large amount of
internal checks. It should be used if you are unsure / worried about
the results minion produces, or it crashes.

To test your minion installation, go into the test_instances directory
and type:

./run_tests.sh ../bin/minion

the "docs" directory contains a full manual for Minion. 
The "benchmarks" directory contains a range of example programs.
The "generators" directory contains a number of generators. These are
in general poorly documented. Sorry.
The "translator" directory contains a translator from the modelling language
Essence' to the Minion input format.

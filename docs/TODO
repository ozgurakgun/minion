15/10/2006 - Cheaning up this file a bit.

Tiny tasks
----------
* Rewrite memory_management, and merge the two files.
* Don't include all constraints in all files
* Write a proper Make file
* Rewrite test suite in something which isn't bash?



Symmetry - None a the moment. Would be difficult to justify as research?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Provide GAP <-> Minion tunnel
* GAP-LEX (easy) SBDD (harder) SBDS (possible?) SBDS+D (???)
* Automatically detect symmetry of a specification - steal someone else's?
  Need to talk to a group person about this...
* Provide method to give group in Minion specification

Easier specification language
-----------------------------
* Essence' converter
* Provide something like minion-helper in more portable language (Perl?)


Minion internals
----------------
* Get at least BC-AllDiff
	Can we do a new, better GAC-AllDiff?
* Global Cardinality Constraint
* Different var / val orderings
* Create specification -> C++ program convertor
* Parallel Minion 


Things we'd like, but probably won't get
----------------------------------------
A gui.
A really nice thing to let you explore the search space.

Things we won't try to do for 1.0 (open to debate)
--------------------------------------------------

Hybrids (possibly SAT + learning, but later)
Explicit set variables
Minion as GAP package



Done
----

* Clean up the trigger system. Use only addTrigger and addDynamicTrigger.
* Allow reusing tuple vectors in table constraint
	

Abandoned (at least by Chris)
-----------------------------
Hopefully Essence' -> Minion convertor will be finished soon, so give up
  *  OPL converter
  *  Rewrite parser

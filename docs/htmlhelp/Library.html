<h3>/Network</h3>

    Automatically generate a short tuple list from each long tuple list.

    The methods of compression are:

    none : No short tuple list generated (default)
    eager : Use a fast algorithm to produce a reasonable short tuple list (best
    as first choice)
    lazy : Work harder (possibly exponentially) to produce a shorter short tuple
    list
    keeplong : Make a 'short tuple list' with no short tuples (only for
    benchmarking)
</pre>

    This switch allows the user to choose what level of preprocess is
    applied to their model before search commences.

    The choices are:

    - GAC
    - generalised arc consistency (default)
    - all propagators are run to a fixed point
    - if some propagators enforce less than GAC then the model will
    not necessarily be fully GAC at the outset

    - SACBounds
    - singleton arc consistency on the bounds of each variable
    - AC can be achieved when any variable lower or upper bound is a
    singleton in its own domain

    - SAC
    - singleton arc consistency
    - AC can be achieved in the model if any value is a singleton in
    its own domain

    - SSACBounds
    - singleton singleton bounds arc consistency
    - SAC can be achieved in the model when domains are replaced by either
    the singleton containing their upper bound, or the singleton containing
    their lower bound

    - SSAC
    - singleton singleton arc consistency
    - SAC can be achieved when any value is a singleton in its own domain

    These are listed in order of roughly how long they take to
    achieve. Preprocessing is a one off cost at the start of search. The
    success of higher levels of preprocessing is problem specific; SAC
    preprocesses may take a long time to complete, but may reduce search
    time enough to justify the cost.

    By default Minion adds all variables to the varorder, to ensure that all
    variables
    are branched assigned before a solution is outputted. This option disables
    that
    behaviour. This means minion Minion may output solutions incorrectly, or
    incorrect
    numbers of solutions. This flag is provided because some users require this
    low-level control over the search, but is in general useless and dangerous.
    In particular,
    it will not speed up search (except when the speed up is due to producing
    garbage of course!)
</pre>
<h3>/Network</h3>

    To stop search after N seconds (CPU time), do

    Randomises the ordering of the decision variables, and the value ordering.
    If the input file specifies as ordering it will randomly permute this. If no
    ordering is
    specified a random permutation of all the variables is used.

<h3>/Network</h3>

    Set the pseudorandom seed to N. This allows 'random' behaviour to be
    repeated in different runs of minion.

    Append a line of data about the current run of minion to a named file.
    This data includes minion version information, arguments to the
    executable, build and solve time statistics, etc. See the file itself
    for a precise schema of the supplied information.

    When Minion is terminated before the end of search, write out two new input
    files that split the remaining search space in half. Each of the files will
    have
    all the variables and constraints of the original file plus constraints that
    rule out the search already done. In addition, the domain of the variable
    under
    consideration when Minion was stopped is split in half with each of the new
    input files considering a different half.

    This feature is experimental and intended to facilitate parallelisation --
    to
    parallelise the solving of a single constraint problem, stop and split
    repeatedly. Please note that large-scale testing of this feature was limited
    to
    Linux systems and it might not work on others (especially Windows).

    The name of the new input files is composed of the name of the original
    instance, the string 'resume', a timestamp, the process ID of Minion, the
    name
    of the variable whose domain is being split and 0 or 1. Each of the new
    input
    files has a comment identifying the name of the input file which it was
    split
    from. Similarly, Minion's output identifies the new input files it writes
    when
    splitting.

    The new input files can be run without any special flags.

    This flag is intended to be used with the -timelimit, -sollimit, -nodelimit
    or -cpulimit flags. Please note that changing other flags between
    runs (such as -varorder) may have unintended consequences.

    Implies -makeresume.
</pre>
<h3>/Network</h3>
<pre>
    The flag -split-stderr has the same function as the flag -split, however the
    two new Minion input files are sent to standard error rather than written to
    files.

    See documentation for -split.

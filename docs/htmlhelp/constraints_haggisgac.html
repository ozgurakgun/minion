<h3>Description</h3>
<pre>
An extensional constraint that enforces GAC. This constraint make uses
of 'short tuples', which allow some values to be marked as "don't care".
When this allows the set of tuples to be reduced in size, this leads to
performance gains.

The variables used in the constraint have to be BOOL or DISCRETE variables.
Other types are not supported.
</pre>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>

Consider the constraint "min([x1,x2,x3],x4)" on Booleans variables
x1,x2,x3,x4.

Represented as a TUPLELIST for a table or gacschema constraint, this would
look like:

**TUPLELIST**
mycon 8 4
0 0 0 0
0 0 1 0
0 1 0 0
0 1 1 0
1 0 0 0
1 0 1 0
1 1 0 0
1 1 1 1

Short tuples give us a way of shrinking this list. Short tuples consist
of pairs (x,y), where x is a varible position, and y is a value for that 
variable. For example:

[(0,0),(3,0)]

Represents "If the variable at index 0 is 0, and the variable at index
3 is 0, then the constraint is true".

This allows us to represent our constraint as follows:

**SHORTTUPLELIST**
mycon 4
[(0,0),(3,0)]
[(1,0),(3,0)]
[(2,0),(3,0)]
[(0,1),(1,1),(2,1),(3,1)]

Note that some tuples are double-represented here. The first 3 short
tuples all allow the assignment '0 0 0 0'. This is fine. The important
thing for efficency is to try to give a small list of short tuples.


We use this tuple by writing:

haggisgac([x1,x2,x3,x4], mycon)

and now the variables [x1,x2,x3,x4] will satisfy the constraint mycon.

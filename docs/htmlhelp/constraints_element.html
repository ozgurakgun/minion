<h3>Description</h3>
<pre>
The constraint 

   element(vec, i, e)

specifies that, in any solution, vec[i] = e and i is in the range 
[0 .. |vec|-1].
</pre>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<pre>

Warning: This constraint is not confluent. Depending on the order the
propagators are called in Minion, the number of search nodes may vary when
using element. To avoid this problem, use watchelement instead. More details
below.

The level of propagation enforced by this constraint is not named, however it
works as follows. For constraint vec[i]=e:

- After i is assigned, ensures that min(vec[i]) = min(e) and 
  max(vec[i]) = max(e).

- When e is assigned, removes idx from the domain of i whenever e is not an
  element of the domain of vec[idx].

- When m[idx] is assigned, removes idx from i when m[idx] is not in the domain
  of e.

This level of consistency is designed to avoid the propagator having to scan
through vec, except when e is assigned. It does a quantity of cheap propagation
and may work well in practise on certain problems.

Element is not confluent, which may cause the number of search nodes to vary
depending on the order in which constraints are listed in the input file, or 
the order they are called in Minion. For example, the following input causes
Minion to search 41 nodes.

MINION 3
**VARIABLES**
DISCRETE x[5] {1..5}
**CONSTRAINTS**
element([x[0],x[1],x[2]], x[3], x[4])
alldiff([x])
**EOF**

However if the two constraints are swapped over, Minion explores 29 nodes.
As a rule of thumb, to get a lower node count, move element constraints
to the end of the list.

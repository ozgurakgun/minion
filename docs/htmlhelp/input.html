<h1>Help on <tt>input</tt></h1>
<h3>Description</h3>
<pre>

Minion expects to be provided with the name of an input file as an
argument. This file contains a specification of the CSP to be solved
as well as settings that the search process should use. The format is

Minion3Input::= MINION 3
                &lt;InputSection&gt;+
                **EOF**

InputSection::= &lt;VariablesSection&gt; 
              | &lt;SearchSection&gt;
              | &lt;ConstraintsSection&gt; 
              | &lt;TuplelistSection&gt;

i.e. 'MINION 3' followed by any number of variable, search,
constraints and tuplelists sections (can repeat) followed by
'**EOF**', the end of file marker.

All text from a '#' character to the end of the line is ignored.

See the associated help entries below for information on each section.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<pre>
You can give an input file via standard input by specifying '--' as the file
name, this might help when minion is being used as a tool in a shell script or
for compressed input, e.g.,

   gunzip -c myinput.minion.gz | minion
</pre>

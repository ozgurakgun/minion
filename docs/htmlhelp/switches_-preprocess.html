<pre>

This switch allows the user to choose what level of preprocess is
applied to their model before search commences.

The choices are:

- GAC
- generalised arc consistency (default)
- all propagators are run to a fixed point
- if some propagators enforce less than GAC then the model will
not necessarily be fully GAC at the outset

- SACBounds
- singleton arc consistency on the bounds of each variable
- AC can be achieved when any variable lower or upper bound is a
singleton in its own domain

- SAC
- singleton arc consistency
- AC can be achieved in the model if any value is a singleton in
its own domain

- SSACBounds
- singleton singleton bounds arc consistency
- SAC can be achieved in the model when domains are replaced by either
the singleton containing their upper bound, or the singleton containing
their lower bound

- SSAC
- singleton singleton arc consistency
- SAC can be achieved when any value is a singleton in its own domain

These are listed in order of roughly how long they take to
achieve. Preprocessing is a one off cost at the start of search. The
success of higher levels of preprocessing is problem specific; SAC
preprocesses may take a long time to complete, but may reduce search
time enough to justify the cost.

<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
To enforce SAC before search:

   minion -preprocess SAC myinputfile.minion

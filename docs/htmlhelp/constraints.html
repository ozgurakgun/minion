<h1>Help on <tt>constraints</tt></h1>
<h3>Description</h3>
<pre>
Minion supports many constraints and these are regularly being
improved and added to. In some cases multiple implementations of the
same constraints are provided and we would appreciate additional
feedback on their relative merits in your problem.

Minion does not support nesting of constraints, however this can be
achieved by auxiliary variables and reification.

Variables can be replaced by constants. You can find out more on
expressions for variables, vectors, etc. in the section on variables.

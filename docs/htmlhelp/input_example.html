Below is a complete minion input file with commentary, as an example.

MINION 3

# While the variable section doesn't have to come first, you can't
really do anything until
# You have one...
**VARIABLES**

# There are 4 type of variables
BOOL bool         # Boolean don't need a domain
BOUND b {1..3}    # Bound vars need a domain given as a range
DISCRETE d {1..3} # So do discrete vars

#Note: Names are case sensitive!

# Internally, Bound variables are stored only as a lower and upper bound
# Whereas discrete variables allow any sub-domain

SPARSEBOUND s {1,3,6,7} # Sparse bound variables take a sorted list of values

# We can also declare matrices of variables!

DISCRETE q[3] {0..5} # This is a matrix with 3 variables: q[0],q[1] and q[2]
BOOL bm[2,2] # A 2d matrix, variables bm[0,0], bm[0,1], bm[1,0], bm[1,1]
BOOL bn[2,2,2,2] # You can have as many indices as you like!

#The search section is entirely optional
**SEARCH**

# Note that everything in SEARCH is optional, and can only be given at
# most once!

# If you don't give an explicit variable ordering, one is generated.
# These can take matrices in interesting ways like constraints, see below.
VARORDER [bool,b,d]

# If you don't give a value ordering, 'ascending' is used
#VALORDER [a,a,a,a]

# You can have one objective function, or none at all.
MAXIMISING bool
# MINIMISING x3

# both (MAX/MIN)IMISING and (MAX/MIN)IMIZING are accepted...


# Print statement takes a vector of things to print

PRINT [bool, q]

# You can also give:
# PRINT ALL (the default)
# PRINT NONE


# Declare constraints in this section!
**CONSTRAINTS**

# Constraints are defined in exactly the same way as in MINION input
formats 1 & 2
eq(bool, 0)
eq(b,d)

# To get a single variable from a matrix, just index it
eq(q[1],0)
eq(bn[0,1,1,1], bm[1,1])

# It's easy to get a row or column from a matrix. Just use _ in the
indices you want
# to vary. Just giving a matrix gives all the variables in that matrix.

#The following shows how flattening occurs...

# [bm] == [ bm[_,_] ] == [ bm[0,0], bm[0,1], bm[1,0], bm[1,1] ]
# [ bm[_,1] ] = [ bm[0,1], bm[1,1] ]
# [ bn[1,_,0,_] = [ bn[1,0,0,0], b[1,0,0,1], b[1,1,0,0], b[1,1,0,1] ]

# You can string together a list of such expressions!

lexleq( [bn[1,_,0,_], bool, q[0]] , [b, bm, d] )

# One minor problem.. you must always put [ ] around any matrix expression, so
# lexleq(bm, bm) is invalid

lexleq( [bm], [bm] ) # This is OK!

# Can give tuplelists, which can have names!
# The input is: &lt;name&gt; &lt;num_of_tuples&gt; &lt;tuple_length&gt; &lt;numbers...&gt;
# The formatting can be about anything..

**TUPLELIST**

Fred 3 3
0 2 3
2 0 3
3 1 3

Bob 2 2 1 2 3 4

#No need to put everything in one section! All sections can be reopened..
**VARIABLES**

# You can even have empty sections.. if you want

**CONSTRAINTS**

#Specify tables by their names..

table([q], Fred)

# Can still list tuples explicitally in the constraint if you want at
the moment.
# On the other hand, I might remove this altogether, as it's worse than giving
# Tuplelists

table([q],{ &lt;0,2,3&gt;,&lt;2,0,3&gt;,&lt;3,1,3&gt; })

#Must end with the **EOF** marker!

**EOF**

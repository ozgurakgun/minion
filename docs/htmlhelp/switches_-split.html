<h1>Help on <tt>switches -split</tt></h1>
<h3>Description</h3>
<pre>
When Minion is terminated before the end of search, write out two new input
files that split the remaining search space in half. Each of the files will have
all the variables and constraints of the original file plus constraints that
rule out the search already done. In addition, the domain of the variable under
consideration when Minion was stopped is split in half with each of the new
input files considering a different half.

This feature is experimental and intended to facilitate parallelisation -- to
parallelise the solving of a single constraint problem, stop and split
repeatedly. Please note that large-scale testing of this feature was limited to
Linux systems and it might not work on others (especially Windows).

The name of the new input files is composed of the name of the original
instance, the string 'resume', a timestamp, the process ID of Minion, the name
of the variable whose domain is being split and 0 or 1. Each of the new input
files has a comment identifying the name of the input file which it was split
from. Similarly, Minion's output identifies the new input files it writes when
splitting.

The new input files can be run without any special flags.

This flag is intended to be used with the -timelimit, -sollimit, -nodelimit
,-searchlimit or -cpulimit flags. Please note that changing other flags between
runs (such as -varorder) may have unintended consequences.

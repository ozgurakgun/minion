The following directory is full of Minion tests. To add a new test, do the
following:

1) Put the file in here, with the extension .minion

2) Make sure that the "print" command prints a matrix, which contains
   on a single line (it can be empty)
   
3) Put one of the following as the very first line, after "MINION x"

   #TEST NOSOLS
     There are no solutions
   #TEST CHECKONESOL x x x ...
     The first solution found will be x x x ... (as given by the "print" 
     statement).
   #TEST SOLCOUNT x
     There will be x solutions found in the whole search
   #TEST NOSOLS
     There will be no solutions found (use SOLCOUNT 0, this will be removed).
 
 
If any line of the file is:
   #FAIL
   
Then the test script will instead check to see if the solver fails rather
than succeds. Note this is done in the test script, not in the solver itself,
which will ignore the #FAIL as a comment.

You should try to be careful if using #FAIL that the file can only fail for
the reason you want, for example if you want to test a parsing failure,
put in #TEST SOLCOUNT 0, then a constraint eq(x0,-999) (assuming -999 is not in
the domain of x0).

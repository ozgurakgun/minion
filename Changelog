	* Going to try to start to keep changelog up to date!
	* Replaced many occurrences of bool with BOOL. BOOL is defined to be
	  int. This is used because in most cases bool and int are 
	  interchangable. (except when you want true to be equal 1), 
	  but can interfere with optimisation.
	* Removed the ability to add static triggers to domain values, as only
	  one constraint (GACElement) was using it, it's faster without, and the
	  GeCode people agree it only makes things slower.
